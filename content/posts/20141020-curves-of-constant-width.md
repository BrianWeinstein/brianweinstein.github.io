A [curve of constant width](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_of_constant_width) is a [convex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_and_concave_polygons), two-dimensional shape that, when rotated inside a square, always makes contact with all four sides.

A circle is the most obvious (but somewhat [trivial](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Trivial.html)) example. Some non-trivial examples are the odd-sided [Reuleaux polygons](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ReuleauxPolygon.html) — the first four of which are shown above.

Since they don't have fixed [axes of rotation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_around_a_fixed_axis), curves of constant width (except the circle) have few practical applications. One notable use of the Reuleaux triangle, though, is in drilling holes in the shape of a slightly rounded square (watch one of the triangle's vertices and notice the shape it traces out as it spins).

On a less technical note, all curves of constant width are solutions to the brainteaser, "Other than a circle, what shape can you make a manhole cover such that it can't fall through the hole it covers?"
