The [wave equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation)&nbsp;is a [partial differential equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation) that describes the propagation of various types of waves.

The equation appears throughout many fields in physics, including acoustics, fluid dynamics,&nbsp;electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics. With some modifications, it can even describe the spread of traffic jams on busy highways!

The one-dimensional equation was first discovered by [d’Alembert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_le_Rond_d%27Alembert)&nbsp;in 1746&nbsp;as he studied how vibrations propagated through a string, and the two- and three-dimensional equations were solved&nbsp;soon after&nbsp;by [Euler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler)&nbsp;during his study of acoustics.

The simulations above show the propagation of a disturbance on a two-dimensional surface for two different sets of [boundary conditions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_value_problem) [[1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_boundary_condition)]&nbsp;[[2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neumann_boundary_condition)].
