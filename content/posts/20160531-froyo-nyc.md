I love frozen yogurt. When I first moved to New York three years ago, I lived only 1/8th of a mile from the closest froyo shop. The convenience of this 4-minute walk is something I neither appreciated nor utilized enough at the time.

After moving to Harlem last year, it’s been harder than ever to satisfy my near-constant craving for this cold candy soup — I’m now a 24-minute walk to the nearest frozen yogurt.

As someone who loves data and has too much time to spare, I decided to find the locations in Manhattan with highest and lowest froyo densitiy. Inspired by Ben Wellington’s work on [I Quant NY](https://iquantny.tumblr.com/), I calculated the distance from every lot in Manhattan to the nearest froyo shop [and mapped it out](https://brianweinstein.carto.com/viz/27dd05e0-2486-11e6-98ba-0e98b61680bf/embed_map).

[https://brianweinstein.cartodb.com/viz/27dd05e0-2486-11e6-98ba-0e98b61680bf/embed_map](https://brianweinstein.cartodb.com/viz/27dd05e0-2486-11e6-98ba-0e98b61680bf/embed_map)


The highest density of froyo is right around West 33rd St. and 8th Ave., with three shops within a 1-block radius. The lowest density is right in Harlem. The red circle on the map shows the location farthest from frozen yogurt. The record belongs to [700 Esplanade Gardens Plaza](https://www.google.com/maps/place/700+Esplanade+Gardens+Plaza,+New+York,+NY+10039/@40.8206054,-73.9375149,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c2f5d6245459fb:0x93cf78be81efe396!8m2!3d40.8206054!4d-73.9353262), a co-op right by the 145th St. stop on the 3-train, with a 51-minute trek across Manhattan to the Pinkberry by Columbia.

[The map](https://brianweinstein.carto.com/viz/27dd05e0-2486-11e6-98ba-0e98b61680bf/embed_map) shows all of the froyo shops in Manhattan, and you can click on any lot to find the distance to the closest shop.

- R code posted [here](https://github.com/BrianWeinstein/manhattan-froyo-map).
- All distances in the map are measured using [great-circle distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance) (i.e., ”[as the crow flies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_the_crow_flies)”), according to the [law of cosines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_cosines#Law_of_cosines_in_non-Euclidean_geometry).
- Frozen yogurt locations were found via the [Google Places Nearby Search API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/search). The API returned some non-froyo-exclusive shops like Ben and Jerry’s, which I kept in the dataset since they technically serve some frozen yogurt (although we all know these shops don’t really count).
- I only included froyo shops that were in Manhattan, so some lots may have a closer shop than the one listed if we include those in other boroughs.
- Manhattan lot locations are from [PLUTO](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-pluto-mappluto.page).
- The map was created using [CartoDB](https://carto.com/).
- Tons of inspiration for this came from Ben Wellington’s work on [I Quant NY](https://iquantny.tumblr.com/).
