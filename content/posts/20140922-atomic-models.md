Evidence-based theories on the structure of atoms have been around since the early 1800s. Dalton’s [billiard ball model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dalton#Main_points_of_Dalton.27s_atomic_theory) was the first on the map, and with further discoveries and experiments — like Thompson’s [discovery of the electron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron#Discovery) and Rutherford’s [gold foil experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geiger%E2%80%93Marsden_experiment) — improved models of atomic structure were introduced.

The first GIF above shows Rutherford’s [planetary model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_model), which was proposed in 1911. In his model, negatively-charged electrons orbit an incredibly small, dense nucleus of positive charge. Despite being a completely incorrect model, most people still think this is what atoms really look like\*. **This is not an atom**. It’s [physically impossible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bremsstrahlung) for electrons to stably orbit like this, and the idea of orbiting electrons was entirely replaced by 1926.

I can’t say what an atom actually _looks_ like, but the most accurate model we have today is governed by the laws of [quantum mechanics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics). The location of an electron is determined by a probability distribution, called an [atomic orbital](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital), which tells us the probability of an electron existing in any specific region around a nucleus. The second image shows the surface around a hydrogen nucleus on which an [excited](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_excitation) electron is most likely to exist.

*Advertisements and popular science articles incorrectly represent atoms all the time. Even the [US Atomic Energy Commission](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Atomic_Energy_Commission) and the [International Atomic Energy Agency](http://www.iaea.org/) use the Rutherford model in their logos!
