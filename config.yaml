            I'm Brian.


            I'm a Senior Quantitative User Experience Researcher at Google, focused on improving the product and UX on Google Search.


            I'm passionate about the intersection of data science, product, and research: from understanding and quantifying user problems to developing and testing product solutions. I also love people management: mentoring teams in data science, research, & communication best practices; finding new opportunities so they can grow; and building a thoughtful and inclusive team cultures.


            I was previously the Director of Data Science & Product Analytics at [Slice](https://slicelife.com/), managing a group of Data Scientists. We worked on the consumer apps, restaurant software, and internal tools; guiding the product direction and helping teams make informed product decisions using data. Before that, I managed the Data Science & Research team at [WeWork](https://www.wework.com/), was a Data Scientist at [WeWork](https://www.wework.com/), and was a Data Scientist at [1stdibs](https://www.1stdibs.com/). I have my Master's degree in applied math and my Bachelor's in physics.


            Outside of data, I enjoy making [pottery](https://www.etsy.com/shop/thingsbybrian/), eating froyo, baking cookies, and running.
