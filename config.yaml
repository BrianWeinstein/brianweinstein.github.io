            I'm Brian.


            I manage a team of Data Scientists and Product Analysts at [Slice](https://slicelife.onelink.me/ylsM/8425733). Our team works on our consumer apps, restaurant software, and internal tools; guiding the product direction and helping teams make informed product decisions using data.


            I'm passionate about the intersection of data science, product, and research: from understanding and quantifying user problems to developing and testing product solutions. I also love people management: mentoring my team in data science and communication best practices, finding new opportunities so they can grow, and building a thoughtful and inclusive team culture.


            Previously I managed the Data Science & Research team at WeWork, was a Data Scientist at WeWork, and was a Data Scientist at 1stdibs. I have my Master's degree in applied math and my Bachelor's in physics.


            Outside of data, I enjoy making [pottery](https://www.etsy.com/shop/thingsbybrian/), eating froyo, baking cookies, and running.
