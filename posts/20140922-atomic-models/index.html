<p>Evidence-based theories on the structure of atoms have been around since the early 1800s. Dalton’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dalton#Main_points_of_Dalton.27s_atomic_theory">billiard ball model</a> was the first on the map, and with further discoveries and experiments — like Thompson’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron#Discovery">discovery of the electron</a> and Rutherford’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geiger%E2%80%93Marsden_experiment">gold foil experiment</a> — improved models of atomic structure were introduced.</p>
<p>The first GIF above shows Rutherford’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_model">planetary model</a>, which was proposed in 1911. In his model, negatively-charged electrons orbit an incredibly small, dense nucleus of positive charge. Despite being a completely incorrect model, most people still think this is what atoms really look like*. <strong>This is not an atom</strong>. It’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bremsstrahlung">physically impossible</a> for electrons to stably orbit like this, and the idea of orbiting electrons was entirely replaced by 1926.</p>
<p>I can’t say what an atom actually <em>looks</em> like, but the most accurate model we have today is governed by the laws of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>. The location of an electron is determined by a probability distribution, called an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital">atomic orbital</a>, which tells us the probability of an electron existing in any specific region around a nucleus.
