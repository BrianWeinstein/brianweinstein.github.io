    <p>I love frozen yogurt. When I first moved to New York three years ago, I lived only 1/8th of a mile from the closest froyo shop. The convenience of this 4-minute walk is something I neither appreciated nor utilized enough at the time.
After moving to Harlem last year, it’s been harder than ever to satisfy my near-constant craving for this cold candy soup — I’m now a 24-minute walk to the nearest frozen yogurt.
As someone who loves data and has too much time to spare, I decided to find the locations in Manhattan with highest and lowest froyo densitiy. Inspired by Ben Wellington’s work on I Quant NY, I calculated the distance from every lot in Manhattan to the nearest froyo shop and mapped it out.
https://brianweinstein.cartodb.com/viz/27dd05e0-2486-11e6-98ba-0e98b61680bf/embed_map
The highest density of froyo is right around West 33rd St. and 8th Ave., with three shops within a 1-block radius. The lowest density is right in Harlem. The red circle on the map shows the location farthest from frozen yogurt. The record belongs to 700 Esplanade Gardens Plaza, a co-op right by the 145th St. stop on the 3-train, with a 51-minute trek across Manhattan to the Pinkberry by Columbia.
The map shows all of the froyo shops in Manhattan, and you can click on any lot to find the distance to the closest shop.
  R code posted here. All distances in the map are measured using great-circle distance (i.e., ”as the crow flies”), according to the law of cosines. Frozen yogurt locations were found via the Google Places Nearby Search API. The API returned some non-froyo-exclusive shops like Ben and Jerry’s, which I kept in the dataset since they technically serve some frozen yogurt (although we all know these shops don’t really count). I only included froyo shops that were in Manhattan, so some lots may have a closer shop than the one listed if we include those in other boroughs. Manhattan lot locations are from PLUTO. The map was created using CartoDB. Tons of inspiration for this came from Ben Wellington’s work on I Quant NY.  ...</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>              The wave equation is a partial differential equation that describes the propagation of various types of waves.
The equation appears throughout many fields in physics, including acoustics, fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics. With some modifications, it can even describe the spread of traffic jams on busy highways!
The one-dimensional equation was first discovered by d’Alembert in 1746 as he studied how vibrations propagated through a string, and the two- and three-dimensional equations were solved soon after by Euler during his study of acoustics.
The simulations above show the propagation of a disturbance on a two-dimensional surface for two different sets of boundary conditions [1] [2].

      Platonic Solids

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>                  A Platonic solid is a polyhedron where (1) each face is the same regular polygon, and (2) each vertex joins the same number of faces.
The Platonic solids are highly symmetrical, and, in three dimensions, only five such solids can exist: the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron.
This was first proven in Euclid’s Elements around 300 B.C., and has since been more rigorously proven using the Euler characteristic. The proofs are relatively easy to follow, and if you’re interested you can check them out both here and here.

    <h2>
      Lonely Runner Conjecture
    </h2>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>                      Imagine n runners on a circular track of length 1. The runners start from the same spot at the same time, and each has a distinct, constant speed. A runner is considered “lonely” whenever it is a distance of at least 1/n from every other runner. The Lonely Runner Conjecture (LRC) states that each runner will eventually, at some point in time, be lonely.
Said differently, the LRC states that for each runner, the spacing around it will eventually be greater than or equal to the spacing it would experience if the all of the runners were equally distributed around the track.
The conjecture has been proven to be true for 7 or fewer runners, but, interestingly enough, has never been proven to work for all cases of 8 or more runners. [In my 8-runner simulation above, I’ve only shown that it works for a specific set of runner speeds — I haven’t proven that it works for all sets of speeds.]
In the GIFs above, an arc appears around a runner whenever the runner is lonely, and the color of a runner fades after it’s been lonely at least once.

      Modeling Comet 67P

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>                      Two weeks ago, the ESA made history by landing a spacecraft on a comet. The spacecraft, named Philae, was carried to Comet 67P by a larger space probe named Rosetta.
Determining where Philae would land was a big step in this mission. Many attributes about the comet, including its topography, were taken into account. To help in this process, the ESA derived a 3D model of the comet’s surface, and the data (made up of over 30,000 measurements) was recently released.
The images above use ESA data to model the surface of 67P. By adjusting lighting and orientation, actual photos taken by Rosetta (images 3 and 5) can be reproduced.
You can play around with the model yourself!
Either use the code below in Mathematica or on the Wolfram Programming Cloud (with a free account), or play with the model online by clicking here*.
