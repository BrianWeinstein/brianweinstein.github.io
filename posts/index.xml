      <title>Mapping the frozen yogurt shop closest to each Manhattan apartment</title>
      <link>https://www.brianweinstein.co/posts/20160531-froyo-nyc/</link>

      <description>I love frozen yogurt. When I first moved to New York three years ago, I lived only 1/8th of a mile from the closest froyo shop. The convenience of this 4-minute walk is something I neither appreciated nor utilized enough at the time.
After moving to Harlem last year, it’s been harder than ever to satisfy my near-constant craving for this cold candy soup — I’m now a 24-minute walk to the nearest frozen yogurt.</description>

      <title>Wave Equation</title>
      <link>https://www.brianweinstein.co/posts/20150128-wave-equation/</link>

      <guid>https://www.brianweinstein.co/posts/20150128-wave-equation/</guid>
      <description>The wave equation is a partial differential equation that describes the propagation of various types of waves.
The equation appears throughout many fields in physics, including acoustics, fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics. With some modifications, it can even describe the spread of traffic jams on busy highways!
The one-dimensional equation was first discovered by d’Alembert in 1746 as he studied how vibrations propagated through a string, and the two- and three-dimensional equations were solved soon after by Euler during his study of acoustics.</description>

      <title>Platonic Solids</title>
      <link>https://www.brianweinstein.co/posts/20150120-platonic-solids/</link>

      <description>A Platonic solid is a polyhedron where (1) each face is the same regular polygon, and (2) each vertex joins the same number of faces.
The Platonic solids are highly symmetrical, and, in three dimensions, only five such solids can exist: the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron.
This was first proven in Euclid’s Elements around 300 B.</description>

      <title>Lonely Runner Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://www.brianweinstein.co/posts/20141225-lonely-runner-conjecture/</link>

      <guid>https://www.brianweinstein.co/posts/20141225-lonely-runner-conjecture/</guid>
      <description>Imagine n runners on a circular track of length 1. The runners start from the same spot at the same time, and each has a distinct, constant speed. A runner is considered “lonely” whenever it is a distance of at least 1/n from every other runner. The Lonely Runner Conjecture (LRC) states that each runner will eventually, at some point in time, be lonely.</description>

      <title>Modeling Comet 67P</title>
      <link>https://www.brianweinstein.co/posts/20141124-comet-67p/</link>

      <description>Two weeks ago, the ESA made history by landing a spacecraft on a comet. The spacecraft, named Philae, was carried to Comet 67P by a larger space probe named Rosetta.
Determining where Philae would land was a big step in this mission. Many attributes about the comet, including its topography, were taken into account.</description>

      <title>Harmonographs</title>
      <link>https://www.brianweinstein.co/posts/20141110-harmonographs/</link>

      <guid>https://www.brianweinstein.co/posts/20141110-harmonographs/</guid>
      <description>A harmonograph is a mechanical device consisting of two or more pendulums attached to a pen. The swinging pendulums control the motion of the pen, tracing out a geometric pattern on a sheet of paper.
Since the system is damped by friction, the pattern spirals in on itself as time progresses.
Each of the GIFs above simulate the output of a 4-pendulum system (modeled after a harmonograph as configured in this video).</description>

      <title>Curves of Constant Width and Odd-Sided Reuleaux Polygons</title>
      <link>https://www.brianweinstein.co/posts/20141020-curves-of-constant-width/</link>

      <guid>https://www.brianweinstein.co/posts/20141020-curves-of-constant-width/</guid>
      <description>A curve of constant width is a convex, two-dimensional shape that, when rotated inside a square, always makes contact with all four sides.
A circle is the most obvious (but somewhat trivial) example. Some non-trivial examples are the odd-sided Reuleaux polygons — the first four of which are shown above.
Since they don&amp;rsquo;t have fixed axes of rotation, curves of constant width (except the circle) have few practical applications.</description>

      <title>Atomic Models</title>
      <link>https://www.brianweinstein.co/posts/20140922-atomic-models/</link>

      <guid>https://www.brianweinstein.co/posts/20140922-atomic-models/</guid>
      <description>Evidence-based theories on the structure of atoms have been around since the early 1800s. Dalton’s billiard ball model was the first on the map, and with further discoveries and experiments — like Thompson’s discovery of the electron and Rutherford’s gold foil experiment — improved models of atomic structure were introduced.
The first GIF above shows Rutherford’s planetary model, which was proposed in 1911.</description>

      <title>Cops and Robbers (and Zombies and Humans)</title>
      <link>https://www.brianweinstein.co/posts/20140902-cops-and-robbers/</link>

      <guid>https://www.brianweinstein.co/posts/20140902-cops-and-robbers/</guid>
      <description>Cops and Robbers is a mathematical game in which pursuers (cops) attempt to capture evaders (robbers). The game is one of many pursuit-evasion games, each of which is governed by a different set of rules. The general goal of these problems is to determine the number of pursuers required to capture a given number of evaders.</description>
